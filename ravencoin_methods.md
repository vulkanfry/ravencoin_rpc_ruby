Returns hex-encoded raw transaction.
Note that the transaction's inputs are not signed, and
it is not stored in the wallet or transmitted to the network.

Paying for Asset Operations:
  Some operations require an amount of RVN to be sent to a burn address:

    Operation          Amount + Burn Address
    transfer                 0
    transferwithmessage      0
    issue                  500 to RXissueAssetXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXhhZGt

    unfreeze_addresses       0
    freeze_asset             0
    unfreeze_asset           0

Assets For Authorization:
  These operations require a specific asset input for authorization:
    Root Owner Token:
      reissue

Output Ordering:
  Asset operations require the following:
    1) All coin outputs come first (including the burn output).
    2) The owner token change output comes next (if required).
    3) An issue, reissue, or any number of transfers comes last
       (different types can't be mixed in a single transaction).

## fundrawtransaction 
fundrawtransaction "hexstring" ( options )

Add inputs to a transaction until it has enough in value to meet its out value.
This will not modify existing inputs, and will add at most one change output to the outputs.
No existing outputs will be modified unless "subtractFeeFromOutputs" is specified.
Note that inputs which were signed may need to be resigned after completion since in/outputs have been added.
The inputs added will not be signed, use signrawtransaction for that.
Note that all existing inputs must have their previous output transaction be in the wallet.
Note that all inputs selected must be of standard form and P2SH scripts must be
in the wallet using importaddress or addmultisigaddress (to calculate fees).
You can see whether this is the case by checking the "solvable" field in the listunspent output.
Only pay-to-pubkey, multisig, and P2SH versions thereof are currently supported for watch-only

Arguments:
1. "hexstring"           (string, required) The hex string of the raw transaction
2. options                 (object, optional)
   {
     "changeAddress"          (string, optional, default pool address) The raven address to receive the change
     "changePosition"         (numeric, optional, default random) The index of the change output
     "includeWatching"        (boolean, optional, default false) Also select inputs which are watch only
     "lockUnspents"           (boolean, optional, default false) Lock selected unspent outputs
     "feeRate"                (numeric, optional, default not set: makes wallet determine the fee) Set a specific fee rate in RVN/kB
     "subtractFeeFromOutputs" (array, optional) A json array of integers.
                              The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each specified output.
                              The outputs are specified by their zero-based index, before any change output is added.
                              Those recipients will receive less ravens than you enter in their corresponding amount field.
                              If no outputs are specified here, the sender pays the fee.
                                  [vout_index,...]
                              Allows this transaction to be replaced by a transaction with higher fees
     "conf_target"            (numeric, optional) Confirmation target (in blocks)
     "estimate_mode"          (string, optional, default=UNSET) The fee estimate mode, must be one of:
         "UNSET"
         "ECONOMICAL"
         "CONSERVATIVE"
   }
                         for backward compatibility: passing in a true instead of an object will result in {"includeWatching":true}

Result:
{
  "hex":       "value", (string)  The resulting raw transaction (hex-encoded string)
  "fee":       n,         (numeric) Fee in RVN the resulting transaction pays
  "changepos": n          (numeric) The position of the added change output, or -1
}

Examples:

Create a transaction with no inputs
> raven-cli createrawtransaction "[]" "{\"myaddress\":0.01}"

Add sufficient unsigned inputs to meet the output value
> raven-cli fundrawtransaction "rawtransactionhex"

Sign the transaction
> raven-cli signrawtransaction "fundedtransactionhex"

Send the transaction
> raven-cli sendrawtransaction "signedtransactionhex"

## getrawtransaction

## estimatefee 
estimatefee nblocks

DEPRECATED. Please use estimatesmartfee for more intelligent estimates.
Estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin
confirmation within nblocks blocks. Uses virtual transaction size of transaction
as defined in BIP 141 (witness data is discounted).

Arguments:
1. nblocks     (numeric, required)

Result:
n              (numeric) estimated fee-per-kilobyte

A negative value is returned if not enough transactions and blocks
have been observed to make an estimate.
-1 is always returned for nblocks == 1 as it is impossible to calculate
a fee that is high enough to get reliably included in the next block.

Example:
> raven-cli estimatefee 6

## estimatesmartfee 
estimatesmartfee conf_target ("estimate_mode")

Estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin
confirmation within conf_target blocks if possible and return the number of blocks
for which the estimate is valid. Uses virtual transaction size as defined
in BIP 141 (witness data is discounted).

Arguments:
1. conf_target     (numeric) Confirmation target in blocks (1 - 1008)
2. "estimate_mode" (string, optional, default=CONSERVATIVE) The fee estimate mode.
                   Whether to return a more conservative estimate which also satisfies
                   a longer history. A conservative estimate potentially returns a
                   higher feerate and is more likely to be sufficient for the desired
                   target, but is not as responsive to short term drops in the
                   prevailing fee market.  Must be one of:
       "UNSET" (defaults to CONSERVATIVE)
       "ECONOMICAL"
       "CONSERVATIVE"

Result:
{
  "feerate" : x.x,     (numeric, optional) estimate fee rate in RVN/kB
  "errors": [ str... ] (json array of strings, optional) Errors encountered during processing
  "blocks" : n         (numeric) block number where estimate was found
}

The request target will be clamped between 2 and the highest target
fee estimation is able to return based on how long it has been running.
An error is returned if not enough transactions and blocks
have been observed to make an estimate for any number of blocks.

Example:
> raven-cli estimatesmartfee 6

## getbalance 
getbalance ( "account" minconf include_watchonly )

If account is not specified, returns the server's total available balance.
If account is specified (DEPRECATED), returns the balance in the account.
Note that the account "" is not the same as leaving the parameter out.
The server total may be different to the balance in the default "" account.

Arguments:
1. "account"         (string, optional) DEPRECATED. The account string may be given as a
                     specific account name to find the balance associated with wallet keys in

                     associated with wallet keys not in any named account, or as "*" to find
                     the balance associated with all wallet keys regardless of account.
                     When this option is specified, it calculates the balance in a different

                     there are conflicting pending transactions (such as those created by
                     the bumpfee command), temporarily resulting in low or even negative
                     balances. In general, account balance calculation is not considered
                     reliable and has resulted in confusing outcomes, so it is recommended to
                     avoid passing this argument.
2. minconf           (numeric, optional, default=1) Only include transactions confirmed at least this many times.
